	<p> Team FluTracker Project 1 <br>
This document contains the Summary and Key Planning notes for Team FluTraker Project 1. Team Members:
<br>
Ben Gordon <br><br>
Joe Lee <br><br>
Lee Hughes <br><br>
Project Milestones <br><br>
Initial Data Source Research Internal Review:   12/18 Monday <br><br>
Data Retrievel Finalized. Cleansing Review:   12/23 Saturday <br><br>
Visualization Renderings. Findings Review: 1/3 Wednesday <br><br>
Presentation Contributions Due: 1/6 Saturday <br><br>
Presentation Due: 1/8 Monday <br><br>
Project Proposal <br><br>
Objective: Investigate historical Per-Capita Flu Outbreaks against the following possible datasets/drivers: <br><br>

Weather influencers <br><br>
Travel - Air <br><br>
Travel - Highway <br><br>
Vaccination History <br><br>
Finding Data <br><br>
The team will bring data into the code folder. CSV files, if required will be stored in code/data. <br><br>
Separate python files can contain exploration of each dataset. The team will review each others findings through by reviewing the code.
<br><br>
Flu Incidents (Joe) <br><br>
Population (Lee) <br><br>
Weather (Ben) <br><br>
Highway Travel (Joe) <br><br>
Air Travel (Lee) <br><br>
Vaccination (Ben) <br><br>
Summary of Analysis <br><br>
Weather highly correlated to influenza incidents <br><br>

Vaccinations in 2015 seemed to be more effective than that of 2016 <br><br>

Air travel during times of influenza spikes show that passenger inflow/outflow counts are close to even.
